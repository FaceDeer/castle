Many of the nodes are used for the outer-walls or dungeons.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nContains as of now:\r\n\r\n* Walls, Corner-walls,\r\n* Castlestone Stairs, Slabs, and Pillars\r\n* Jailbars\r\n* Hides\r\n* Arrowslits\r\n* Rubble (for between walls)\r\n* Doors\r\n* and more!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**\"** _Although crossbows have been removed, along with arrows, the code is still there. To get the crossbows back, look in init.lua. You will see at the top some lines with dofile in them. Copy and paste two more of these lines, and change them to crossbow.lua and arrow.lua to get them back._ **\"** --DanDuncombe\r\n    \r\nI, will take a look at the arrows and crossbows, and see about this. And on the subject, I hope that I will be developing this mod more and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Licence: GPLv3**\r\n\r\n**see: LICENSE**","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
